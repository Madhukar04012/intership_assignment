# AI/ML Internship - Week 1 Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the **Week 1 Python Fundamentals** assignment. The project demonstrates core Python concepts including operators, data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), NumPy integration, file handling, and a real-world mini-project.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `internship_assignment.py`: Main Python script containing all 5 tasks.
- `ai_students.txt`: Text file generated by the script to store student records (Task 4).
- `prompt_history.txt`: Log file for the AI Prompt Logger mini-project (Task 5).

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    Ensure you have Python installed. You also need to install the `numpy` library:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

2.  **Execute the Script:**
    Run the main file using Python:
    ```bash
    python internship_assignment.py
    ```

3.  **Navigate the Menu:**
    The program uses an interactive menu to select tasks:
    - **Option 1**: Basic Operators & Arithmetic
    - **Option 2**: Lists & NumPy Statistics
    - **Option 3**: Dictionaries & Set Operations
    - **Option 4**: File Handling (Read/Write)
    - **Option 5**: AI Prompt Logger (Mini Input Project)

## 📋 Assignment Details

### Task 1: Python Basics & Operators
- Takes two numbers as input.
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication.
- Implements safe division and modulus (handles division by zero).
- Demonstrates comparison and logical operators.

### Task 2: Lists & NumPy
- Generates a list of 10 random integers.
- Safely removes elements using `pop()`.
- Sorts the list and finds max/min values.
- Converts the list to a **NumPy array** to calculate:
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Standard Deviation

### Task 3: Dictionaries & Sets
- **Dictionary**: Stores student name, course, and marks. automatically assigns a grade (A/B/C/D) based on marks.
- **Sets**: Manages two sets of AI tools to demonstrate `union` and `intersection` operations.

### Task 4: File Handling
- Creates a file `ai_students.txt` with student data.
- Reads the file and filters/displays students who scored **above 75 marks**.

### Task 5: Real-World Mini Project (AI Prompt Logger)
- Simulates an AI tool's logging system.
- Accepts a user prompt, attaches the current **timestamp**, and appends it to `prompt_history.txt`.
